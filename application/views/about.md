Welcome to my website. My name is Phill. I'm a 26 year old Web Developer from Leicester, UK. In 2009 I graduated from [Loughborough University](http://www.lboro.ac.uk/) with a Masters of Computer Science.

Since 2009 I have worked for [Cuttlefish Multimedia](http://cuttlefish.com/) supporting the Senior Developers and developing locative technology for the company. As a student I developed '[My Charnwood](http://my.charnwood.gov.uk/)', a service for residents of the Charnwood Borough to easily find information about their property and local council services.  Since graduating I have continued to update My Charnwood and a number of other projects.

My main skills lie in programming although I am developing an understanding of design.  I am proficient in XHTML/HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL.  I have some experience with C, C++, Java, Perl, Prolog and VB (also VBA and VBScript).

When I am not programming I enjoy Climbing and [Scouting](http://hinckleydistrict.org.uk/).  In the past I supported the [youth councils of Leicestershire](http://www.thejitty.com/yc/).
